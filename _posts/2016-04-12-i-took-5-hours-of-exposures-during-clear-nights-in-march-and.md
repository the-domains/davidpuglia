description: "I took 5 hours of exposures during clear nights in March and April of the Rosette Nebula. This is an RGB image using HA,OIII, and SII narrowband filters for each channel. The Rosette Nebula (also known as Caldwell 49) is a large, spherical nebula in an H II region located near one end of a giant molecular cloud in the Monoceros region of the Milky Way Galaxy. The open cluster NGC 2244 (Caldwell 50) is closely associated with the nebulosity, the stars of the cluster having been formed from the nebula's matter. This Nebula is 5000 light years from earth"
